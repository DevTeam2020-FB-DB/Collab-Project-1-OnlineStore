Feedback Notes and Modificaions: Nathan.




1. Lots of repetition among HTML files: 

    ---> Sidebar listings for "Men", "Women", "Teens", "Kids", and "Menu" contains 4 sub-category sub-headings and 4 sample product cards on each html page. 

    ---> Much of this can be reduced so that each HTML page can be reduced to its unique features while maintaining common structure.
